## Arrays 101

### Initialization 
* Initialize with capacity n.
* Indices 0-n.
* Capacity vs Length (Must keep tack).
* Null(Objects) vs default value (Primitive Types).
* Dimension is calculated when initialized with input.

### Insertion
* Shift right.
* Traverse from end.
* Counter will take its previous value. 
* Length increases.

### Deletion
* Shift left.
* Traverse from start.
* Counter will take its next value. 
* Length decreases.

### Search
* Linear Search O(n) - unsorted.
* Binary Search O(log n) -sorted.

### Inplace Operation (No additional Space)
* Multiple pointers.
* Negation concepts.
* Sets and Hash tables.
* Circular arrays.
